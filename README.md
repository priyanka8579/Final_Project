## 🌐 Website Analytics & Conversion Rate Optimization
Type: Job Simulation | Group Project | Marketing & Digital Analytics
Topics Covered: Web Analytics, Funnel Analysis, User Segmentation, SQL, Power BI, Python, UX Recommendations

## Project Overview
ClickWave, a mid-sized e-commerce company, is facing high traffic but low conversions. As part of a Web Analytics Consulting Team, our goal was to uncover issues in the website funnel and provide actionable recommendations to improve conversions.
This project simulates a real-world business case where web traffic data is analyzed, segmented, and visualized to deliver data-driven UX and marketing strategies.

## Business Problem
The CMO identified three issues:
-High bounce rates on product pages
-Poor user experience during checkout
-Misalignment between traffic sources and user intent

#### We analyzed the dataset to answer:
-Why are users dropping off?
-Where is the funnel breaking?
-What improvements can boost conversions?

## Project Goals
-Explore and clean website traffic dataset
-Identify user behavior patterns and bounce points
-Visualize conversion funnels
-Segment users by device, source, or region
-Recommend improvements in landing pages and UX
-Deliver a final report with data-backed insights

## Tools & Technologies
Excel & Power Query:	Data preprocessing, cleaning, transformation
SQL:	Data extraction & segmentation
Python: (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)	Exploratory analysis, funnel metrics
Power BI:	Interactive funnel & segmentation dashboards
